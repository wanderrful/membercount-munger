Periodically scrapes the given Steamcommunity.com group page, read from the GROUP\_NAME environment variable, for the current numbers of online group members.  It then records the data, along with a timestamp, into a PostgreSQL database for later analysis!  The frequency of scrapes is defined by the CHECK\_INTERVAL environment variable.

This repo works in conjunction with my own personal Heroku app so that it runs persistently.
